se-interpreter
==============

This is a command-line tool for interpreting [Selenium Builder](http://www.sebuilder.com) JSON script files, based on its [Java equivalent](https://github.com/sebuilder/se-builder/wiki/Se-Interpreter). You can supply scripts to the interpreter and have them played back on a Selenium server. You can also import the interpreter as a npm dependency and use it as a library, attaching listeners to get detailed information at each state of the playback process, and controlling the step-by-step execution.

se-interpreter is currently under development and only has a very limited feature set. It is not yet available through npm.
